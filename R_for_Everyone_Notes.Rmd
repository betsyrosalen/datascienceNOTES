## Installing and Setting Up R and RStudio

1. **Run the installer as an administrator** for **both R and RStudio** by right clicking and selecting run as administrator.
2. **Choose a directory with NO SPACES** in the name to install **R and RStudio**.  Directly under the C: Drive works...

### If antivirus won't move packages out of temp folder...

1. Try to install the packages
2. when you get the error message saying that the files could not be moved and are in the temp folder 
    a. go to that temp folder
    b. LEAVE RSTUDIO OPEN (otherwise the temp files are deleted).  
    c. The temp folder contains zip files that you then need to extract to the location of your library which is also noted in the error message.  
    d. Although I had to install directly in the "Library" folder the error tagged another folder on the end that wasn't there.  Some packages have dependencies that need to be installed first, so I had to just keep checking the temp folder and installing the dependencies first then try again...  Eventually I got them all, but it was a back and forth try and retry sort of thing.
    
### Installing Packages

`install.packages("package_Name")`

#### Installing packages from GitHub

```
library(devtools)
install_github(repo="package_name/username")
```

#### Installing packages from .zip or tar.gz

Go to the menu to install packages and change the "Install from:" dropdown to the correct type.

### Loading Packages

Can be done with either `library(package, quietly=TRUE)` or `require()`
Preferable to use `library` when writing scripts.

`quietly=TRUE` attribute will hide any waaranings or errors fro showing up in your knit documents.

`coefplot::coefplot(object)` allows the function to be called without loading the package first and ensures that if there are two packages with the same function that the right one is called.

## The R Environment

Mac interface has the most features.

Do not ssave .RData files on startup to starta fresh session each time and avoid problems.

To repeat a line of code press the `up arrow` key and `Enter`.  You can scroll through your whole history of lines of code this way by just pressing the up arrow multiple times.

Interrupt a command with `Esc`

`Command+Enter` to run just one line of code where youu place your cursor, or to run multiple lines of code you selected.  

`Ctrl+Shift+S` to run an entire file of code.

`Tab` to autocomplete

### Keyboard Shortcuts

*Full list is available directly in the RStudio IDE under the Tools menu:*
