## Functions

### Vertical Shift
Given a function f(x), if we define a new function g(x) as ()()gxfxk=+, where k is a constant
then g(x) is a vertical shift of the function f(x), where all the output values have been increased by k.

- If k is positive, then the graph will shift up
- If k is negative, then the graph will shift down

### Horizontal Shift
Given a function f(x), if we define a new function g(x) as ()()gxfxk=+, where k is a constant
then g(x) is a horizontal shift of the function f(x)

- If k is positive, then the graph will shift left
- If k is negative, then the graph will shift right

### Reflections
Given a function f(x), if we define a new function g(x) as ()()gxfx=−,
then g(x) is a vertical reflection of the function f(x), sometimes called a reflection about the x-axis
If we define a new function g(x) as ()()gxfx=−,
then g(x) is a horizontal reflection of the function f(x), sometimes called a reflection about the y-axis

### Vertical Stretch/Compression
Given a function f(x), if we define a new function g(x) as )()(xkfxg=, where k is a constant
then g(x) is a vertical stretch or compression of the function f(x).

- If k > 1, then the graph will be stretched
- If 0< k < 1, then the graph will be compressed
- If k < 0, then there will be combination of a vertical stretch or compression with a vertical reflection
